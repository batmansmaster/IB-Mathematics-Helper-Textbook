\chapter{Graph Theory}
Graph theory is a topic that's unrelated to everything else in the syllabus, making it a unique topic that requires a different way of thinking and solving problems.
Fortunately, this means that studying graph theory doesn't technically have any prerequisites and can be taken at any time.
What makes it even easier to learn this topic is that graph theory has a lot of applications in real life which are direct and easy to understand, which makes concepts much more intuitive.

\section{Terminologies}
Seeing that the topic is new for most students, we're going to start with some of the most common definitions in graph theory.

\begin{definition}{Graph}
A graph is a set of nodes and edges.
